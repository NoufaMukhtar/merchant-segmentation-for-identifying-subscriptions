"1. Stripe provides a suite of payments, financial services, and business operations products, including:
    - Subscription: APIs for creating and managing subscriptions, recurring payments, and recurring revenue. 
    - Checkout: Prebuilt, Stripe hosted checkout page
    - Payment Link: No-code payment
"
"2. Note that the product usage is not mutually exclusive. For example, a user can use both Checkout and Subscription products for one transaction."
"3. The dataset has future merchant transaction activity from 2041-2042. The data is made up, but you can consider this to be a random sample of future merchants using Stripe. "
"4. Each observation in the `payments` transaction volume is in cents."
